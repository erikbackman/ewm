# EWM

My Window Manager designed specifically for my workflow on an ultrawide monitor.

## Why
I find that tiling window managers are terrible on ultrawide monitors
but most floating window managers are primarly designed to be operated
using a mouse. All I want is a floating window manager so that if I
need to drag a window somewher I can do so without having first make
said window float. When I only need to look at one window (which is
most of the time) I want to be able to just center and resize to what
I consider to be the optimal dimensions, in addition, when I need to
view multiple windows it needs to be able to automate the task of
tiling windows.

Writing a WM that does exactly this is simpler than trying to hack on
an existing one using some made up configuration language.

## Features
- It does what I want
- No configuration
